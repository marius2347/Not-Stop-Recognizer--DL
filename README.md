<h1> Not Stop Recognizer - Neural Network & OpenCV</h1>
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Will develop a new custom classifier using one of the classification methods</li>
    <li>Problem: You have been employed as a Junior Data Scientist by Jokwu, a self-driving car start-up in Capetown, South Africa. Jokwu has created the hardware and parts of the car, and they are beginning to create sensors; the next step is to have a working model that identifies traffic signs. The project and product team have decided to start with stop signs - is it a stop sign or not?</li>
    <li>As a first step, you have been given a dataset and tasked with training a model that identifies the stop signs in an image. This will be integrated into a motion detector as a next step.</li>
    <li>The job: load the training images, create features, and train the model.</li>

</ul>
